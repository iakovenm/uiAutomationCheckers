To run program you need to have JDK installed and JAVA_HOME path set 
In pom.xml file dependencies for Selenium and Junit should be set
target
Solution is implemented without smart move logic due to lack of time.
But I would think in this direction to implement it:

1) Create construct to represent game spaces 
in our case it could be 2-dimensional array add locators for each space.
2) Create construct to represent game board
3) Create construct to represent move and add logic if it is a jump(return (fromRow - toRow == 2 || fromRow - toRow == -2);
4) Add logic for making move that includes using legal moves 
5) Create logic for returning vector with legal moves
6) Create logic for returning legal jumps fom particular position 
7) Implement canJump and canMove methods
8) Implement game construct


Here’s a detailed analysis of each option with the pros and cons to help your team decide on the best path forward:

1. Use Selenium Grid for Browser Support
Overview:
Selenium Grid allows running browser tests on a distributed infrastructure. It supports multiple browsers and versions, and it can be integrated with your CI pipeline.

Pros:
Cross-browser Testing: Wide support for different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
Scalability: Can distribute tests across multiple nodes for parallel execution, speeding up test runs.
Customizability: Flexible setup and configuration options to match your environment.
Established Ecosystem: Widely used and mature, with extensive community support.
Security: You have control over the image configuration, reducing external security vulnerabilities.
Cons:
Performance: Selenium tests are typically slower than Playwright, as it relies on WebDriver.
Complex Setup: Requires setting up and maintaining a Selenium Grid infrastructure, which can be resource-intensive.
Limited Features: Lacks some advanced capabilities Playwright offers (e.g., network interception, direct access to browser context).
Higher Maintenance: Managing grid nodes and keeping them updated requires significant effort.
No Native Support for Headless Mode: Selenium relies on external binaries like ChromeDriver.
2. Use Alpine Node.js Image and Install Playwright
Overview:
Use an Alpine Linux-based Node.js image and install Playwright manually during the Docker build process. This approach allows you to control the dependencies and address security vulnerabilities directly.

Pros:
Lightweight: Alpine images are small and optimized for minimal resources, resulting in faster builds and smaller image sizes.
Customizable: Full control over the installation process, including the ability to remove vulnerable dependencies.
Security: You can update dependencies regularly to mitigate vulnerabilities revealed by security scans.
Playwright Compatibility: Playwright supports Alpine, and its dependencies (e.g., Chromium) can be installed with proper configuration.
Cons:
Compatibility Issues: Alpine uses musl instead of glibc, which can cause compatibility problems with some Playwright dependencies.
Increased Build Time: Installing Playwright and its dependencies manually can significantly increase image build time.
Complexity: Requires fine-tuning dependencies (e.g., glibc, system libraries) to ensure compatibility.
Debugging: Debugging errors related to Playwright setup on Alpine can be challenging.
3. Use Playwright Remote Browser
Overview:
This approach involves running the Playwright tests on a remote browser (e.g., a cloud-hosted service or a remote Playwright server). Playwright's remote browser support can connect to a Playwright server that manages browsers.

Pros:
No Need for Local Browsers: Reduces the need to bundle browsers into your CI environment.
Scalability: Remote browsers can be scaled independently, allowing parallel test execution.
Maintenance-free Infrastructure: Offloads the management of browser binaries to a remote service.
Compatibility with Playwright: Retains all Playwright-specific features, like advanced selectors, network mocking, and intercepting.
Cons:
Latency: Remote connections can introduce latency in test execution, especially for large test suites.
Dependency on External Services: Reliability depends on the availability and performance of the remote server or cloud provider.
Complex Configuration: Requires setting up and managing remote browser servers or integrating with third-party services.
Cost: Depending on the service used, there could be additional costs for hosting or scaling remote browsers.
4. Certify the Current Ubuntu Image (Long-term Strategy)
Overview:
Create a long-term strategy to manage security vulnerabilities by certifying the current Ubuntu Playwright image and applying security patches.

Pros:
Custom Security Management: Allows you to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities specific to your environment.
Stability: Retains the robustness and stability of Ubuntu-based images.
No Change in Framework: Since Playwright officially supports Ubuntu, this option ensures compatibility and reduces changes in your CI pipeline.
Control Over Updates: You can plan for regular updates and patches to manage security concerns.
Cons:
High Maintenance: Requires regular monitoring of vulnerabilities and applying security updates.
Complexity: Managing image certification and keeping it compliant with security standards can be resource-intensive.
Long-term Overhead: This approach involves ongoing effort and doesn't entirely eliminate the risk of vulnerabilities.
Recommendations:
Short-term:
Option 2: Use Alpine Node.js Image:
This is a lightweight solution that gives you more control over dependencies. It requires some upfront work to ensure compatibility and configure glibc, but it can address security vulnerabilities more effectively.
Good for teams with expertise in Docker and dependency management.
Long-term:
Option 4: Certify the Current Ubuntu Image:
For long-term stability, certifying the Ubuntu image is the most robust solution. It allows you to retain Playwright's full functionality while addressing security concerns systematically.
This approach can be combined with automation tools for vulnerability scanning and patching.
Consideration:
If your team values parallelization, scalability, and flexibility, investigate Option 3: Remote Browsers, particularly for running large test suites in a distributed environment.

Could you provide an example of long term solution of Certification for the Current Ubuntu Image if we use nexus scan for security vulnerabilities
ChatGPT powiedział:
ChatGPT
Creating a long-term solution for certifying your current Ubuntu-based Playwright image involves building a pipeline to continuously monitor, scan, and mitigate vulnerabilities detected by tools like Nexus IQ or Nexus Lifecycle. Here’s an example approach:

Step-by-Step Long-Term Certification Strategy
1. Create a Custom Dockerfile for the Base Image
Start with the official Ubuntu Playwright image and create a custom Dockerfile to modify and secure the image.

Dockerfile
Kopiuj
Edytuj
# Use the official Ubuntu-based Playwright image as the base
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.38.0-focal

# Update all packages to their latest secure versions
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get dist-upgrade -y

# Remove unused packages and clean up
RUN apt-get autoremove -y && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Optional: Install security monitoring tools
RUN apt-get install -y lynis clamav

# Re-add any required application-specific dependencies
RUN apt-get install -y curl git jq

# Set non-root user for running the application (security best practice)
RUN groupadd -r playwright && useradd --no-log-init -r -g playwright playwright
USER playwright

# Entry point for the container
ENTRYPOINT ["npx", "playwright"]
2. Integrate Nexus Scan into the CI Pipeline
Add a step in your CI/CD pipeline to scan the Docker image using Nexus IQ or Nexus Lifecycle. Nexus integrates with most CI tools like Jenkins, Harness, or GitHub Actions.

Example Nexus Scan Integration in CI (using Jenkins):
groovy
Kopiuj
Edytuj
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t custom-playwright:latest .'
            }
        }
        stage('Scan Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def scanResults = sh(returnStatus: true, script: """
                        nexus-iq-cli -s https://nexus-iq.example.com -a <user>:<password> \
                        -i custom-playwright:latest \
                        -t docker \
                        -v
                    """)
                    if (scanResults != 0) {
                        error("Image scan failed. Please address vulnerabilities.")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Key Notes:
The nexus-iq-cli tool scans your Docker image and uploads the results to Nexus IQ Server.
Fail the pipeline if critical or high vulnerabilities are detected.
3. Address Vulnerabilities Automatically
Nexus can generate a report detailing the vulnerabilities in your image. For each detected issue:

Identify the affected package and check for updates.
Add fixes directly to your Dockerfile:
For OS vulnerabilities: Ensure packages are updated (e.g., apt-get update and apt-get upgrade).
For Node.js dependencies: Use npm audit fix or yarn audit fix.
4. Automate Patch Releases
Set up a job in your CI pipeline to periodically rebuild and scan the Docker image, ensuring vulnerabilities are mitigated quickly.

Example Scheduled Pipeline for Automated Patches (GitHub Actions):
yaml
Kopiuj
Edytuj
name: Certify Playwright Image

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1' # Weekly on Mondays at 2:00 AM

jobs:
  build-and-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t custom-playwright:latest .
      
      - name: Run Nexus Scan
        run: |
          nexus-iq-cli -s https://nexus-iq.example.com -a ${{ secrets.NEXUS_USER }}:${{ secrets.NEXUS_PASSWORD }} \
          -i custom-playwright:latest \
          -t docker \
          -v
      
      - name: Push Image to Registry (if scan passes)
        if: success()
        run: docker push your-docker-repo/custom-playwright:latest
5. Add Alerting and Reporting
Alerting: Configure Nexus to send alerts if critical vulnerabilities are found, ensuring they are promptly addressed.
Reporting: Generate periodic vulnerability reports from Nexus and review them with your team.
6. Leverage Image Signing and Policies
Use Docker Content Trust (DCT) to sign your images, ensuring only trusted images are deployed.
Use Nexus Repository to set up a policy that prevents deploying unscanned or vulnerable images.
Benefits of This Long-term Solution
Proactive Vulnerability Management: Vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated before deployment.
Compliance: Aligns with security policies and industry standards.
Automation: Minimizes manual intervention with automated scans and patches.
Transparency: Provides detailed reports on the state of your Docker images.

Powiedziałeś(-aś):
I need to think here more of a strategy or approach how to check potential vulnerable libraries
ChatGPT powiedział:
ChatGPT
A strategy for identifying and managing potential vulnerabilities in libraries and dependencies used in your Playwright project involves establishing a proactive approach, leveraging tools for continuous monitoring, and implementing workflows that minimize the risk of introducing vulnerable components into your pipeline. Below is a detailed approach for building such a strategy.

Comprehensive Strategy for Checking Potentially Vulnerable Libraries
1. Build an Inventory of Dependencies
Map All Dependencies:
List all the libraries and packages used directly and indirectly in your project, both in your application and Docker image.

Use tools like npm list --all to visualize all dependencies in your Node.js project.

Example:

bash
Kopiuj
Edytuj
npm list --all > dependency-tree.txt
Categorize by Criticality:
Prioritize based on their role in the system (e.g., authentication libraries are high-risk).
2. Automate Dependency Scanning in CI/CD
Integrate tools into your CI/CD pipelines to scan dependencies for vulnerabilities regularly. These tools provide reports on known vulnerabilities and severity levels.

Recommended Tools:

Node.js Projects: Use npm audit or yarn audit during CI runs to detect issues in Node.js libraries.

Docker Images: Use Snyk, Trivy, or Nexus IQ to scan Docker images for vulnerable libraries and OS-level packages.

Source Code: Use Dependabot or Renovate to identify outdated or vulnerable libraries in GitHub.

Example Workflow for GitHub Actions:

yaml
Kopiuj
Edytuj
name: Dependency Check

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  dependency-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run npm audit
        run: npm audit --json > audit-report.json || exit 0

      - name: Upload Audit Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: audit-report
          path: audit-report.json
Policy Enforcement:

Block builds or deployments if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
Example: Fail CI/CD if npm audit detects vulnerabilities with a CVSS score >7.
3. Maintain a Vulnerability Database
Use Public CVE Databases:
Monitor the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or CVE Details for newly discovered issues in your dependencies.
Use Vendor-Specific Security Feeds:
Leverage tools like Snyk, which aggregate vulnerability data across multiple feeds.
Regularly Update Libraries:
Upgrade dependencies to their latest secure versions regularly.
4. Conduct Periodic Vulnerability Audits
Schedule Regular Scans:

Perform manual or automated audits every sprint or release cycle.
Scan the entire dependency tree for new vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or Trivy.
Audit Third-Party Dependencies:

Analyze external dependencies to determine their trustworthiness:
Look for maintenance signals (e.g., number of contributors, last update).
Assess usage across the community.
5. Use Dependency Pinning
Pin dependency versions in your package.json or package-lock.json file.

Example package.json:

json
Kopiuj
Edytuj
{
  "dependencies": {
    "playwright": "1.38.0",
    "lodash": "4.17.21"
  }
}
Advantages:

Ensures consistent builds and prevents unexpected vulnerabilities from being introduced with new versions.
6. Implement a Vulnerability Remediation Workflow
Define Severity Thresholds:

Classify vulnerabilities into critical, high, medium, and low based on CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).
Example thresholds:
Block build: CVSS >= 7.0
Warning: CVSS between 4.0 and 6.9
Create Action Plans for Vulnerabilities:

Critical: Fix immediately before deploying.
High: Plan for remediation in the current sprint.
Medium/Low: Schedule fixes for future releases unless exploitable.
7. Harden the Environment
Mitigate OS-Level Vulnerabilities:

Use lightweight base images like alpine instead of full Ubuntu when possible.
Example: Switch to node:alpine and install Playwright dependencies explicitly.
Container Hardening:

Apply multi-stage builds to reduce the attack surface by removing build-time dependencies.

Example:

Dockerfile
Kopiuj
Edytuj
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
8. Monitor Vulnerabilities in Production
Set up runtime vulnerability scanning tools:
Use tools like Falco, Sysdig Secure, or Aqua Security to monitor running containers for vulnerable dependencies.
9. Educate Your Team
Train developers and engineers to:
Understand the importance of dependency management.
Use tools like npm audit or yarn audit locally before committing code.
Write secure Dockerfiles and scripts.
Pros and Cons of This Approach
Pros:
Proactive Risk Mitigation: Detect and address vulnerabilities early.
Automation: Reduces manual effort with automated scans.
Compliance: Ensures adherence to security policies and standards.
Transparency: Reports help stakeholders understand the security posture.
Environment Security: Addresses both application and environment vulnerabilities.
Cons:
Effort: Requires initial setup and team alignment.
False Positives: May occasionally report vulnerabilities that are not exploitable.
Tooling Costs: Advanced tools like Snyk or Nexus can be expensive.
Time: Fixing vulnerabilities, especially for deeply nested dependencies, can delay releases.
